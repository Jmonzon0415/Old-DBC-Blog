      Learning about the concepts and stages of version control was very fun and interesting! 
      Thereâ€™re so many benefits of using version control with software development . Version control allows you to upload code and have others make edits and the adds the ability to compare and view what the edits do without effecting the original source. Working on a team remotely or open source to the coding community are huge benefits that come with version control.

      Git Hub is a easy and streamline site to use for version control. Git hub allows to upload your main code (master) to a repository. Depending on your licensing, people are able to copy your master code onto their computer and make edits onto a branch to the code where they are not directly effecting . When they are finished they can push their edits onto the master branch for revision by the owner(s) of the master in the form of a pull request. If the request is liked, the owner may merge the pull to the master branch.The owner can view all the pull request and commits to the master branch.

       Git Hub is a popular website and used by most of the coding community. I use it because it is the only version control I know haha. It seems very user friendly and super easy to track and merge changes.
