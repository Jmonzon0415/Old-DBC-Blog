     This week in Phase-0 we dove into Ruby. Important concepts we learned in ruby were arrays and hashes. These elements are indexes of intergers or strings. Arrays differ from hashes due to them holding an orderd collection of data that can be accessed through index key numbers, 0 being the first in the list. Hashes store data too, but instead of an index key number, data can be called using an object to point to another object (key value pair) in the hash. You can specify what you want the object to be and what you want it to call. Both arrays and hashes are useful in different situations.
