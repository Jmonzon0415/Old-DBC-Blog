<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
        It was Fun, I really enjoyed the process ! We both agreed to make a navagation page to our individual blog posts and we wire framed it.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

        Yes, it was very helpful because it give a direction in how you are going to use the HTML5 semantics when making the template 


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We drew our wireframes out on paper. Just a basic set up with a head and img links to our blogs and a footer.





What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?-->
