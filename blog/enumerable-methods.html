     Enumerable methods are methods that are basically a package or "mixins" of many methods to modify/iterate a collection of data.

     An Enumerable method I want to talk about and teach today is .sort and sort_by. These were the methods I used this week for my group project. .sort and .sort by are both enumerables that sort a collection of data. .sort uses a <=> operator to compare the data to eachother. The .sort_by method only takes one block and compares it to what it is called for.
